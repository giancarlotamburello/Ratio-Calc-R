# Ratio-Calc-R

Ratio Calc R is a computational program suited for processing volcanic gas concentrations time series produced from any multisensor device (aka MultiGAS analyzer).

It is primarily intended for calculating gas molar ratio (e.g. CO₂ and SO₂ ) and error respectively from the slope and the correlation coefficient of the best fit line. In addition, Ratiocalc provides an integration of satellite maps from Google® (by the Google Static Maps API) that enables an identification of the gas sources and/or topographic elements.

This program is an R script and needs the installation of R (https://cran.r-project.org/) and the following packages: _shiny, leaflet, jsonlite, rlang, crayon, fields, sp, geosphere, png, signal, MBA, spatial, fields, splines, aTSA, boot, simpleboot, DT_

Source the contents of the _Ratiocalc.R_ script to run the app in your browser.
